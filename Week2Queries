# What are good indicators of a user who will likely purchase again? 
# What about indicators of users who are likely NOT to purchase again? 
# If you had more data, what features would you want to look into to answer this question?

# If I had more data, I would want to look at user satisfaction. If their satisfaction is high, we can assume
# they will want to purchase again. If satisfaction is low, it's unlikely that they will purchase again.
# Another indicator that a user will likely purchase again is the sessions made to the site after a purchase is made.
