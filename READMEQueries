## How many users do we have?

select
  count(distinct user_id)
from
  dbt_katinajakelgmailcom.users

      # count(distinct user_id): 130

## On average, how many orders do we receive per hour?

with orders_by_hour as (
    select
      count(distinct order_id)
      , date_part('hour', created_at) as order_hour
from
  dbt_katinajakelgmailcom.stg_postgres__orders
group by 2)

select
    avg(order_hour) as avg_order_per_hour
from
    orders_by_hour

    #11.5 orders per hour

## On average, how long does an order take from being placed to being delivered?

with date_difference as(
   select
    order_id
    , DATEDIFF('day', created_at::timestamp, delivered_at::timestamp ) as days_between
from
  dbt_katinajakelgmailcom.stg_postgres__orders)

select
    avg(days_between)
from
    date_difference

    # 3.891803 average time (days) between created and delivery date for orders

## How many users have only made one purchase? Two purchases? Three+ purchases?

with order_counts as (select
    distinct users.user_id as users
    , count(distinct orders.order_id) as orders
from
  dbt_katinajakelgmailcom.stg_postgres__users as users
left join dbt_katinajakelgmailcom.stg_postgres__orders as orders on orders.user_id = users.user_id
group by 1)

    select
        count(distinct order_counts.users)
    from order_counts
    where order_counts.orders = 1

    # 25 users have only made one purchase
    # 28 users have made two purchases

    # 71 users have made 3 or more purcahses

## Note: you should consider a purchase to be a single order. In other words, if a user places one order for 3 products, they are considered to have made 1 purchase.

## On average, how many unique sessions do we have per hour?

My query, altered with the orders placed per hour, yielded the same results, 11.5?
